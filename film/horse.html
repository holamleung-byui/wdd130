                <p>One of the earliest motion pictures is "Horse in Motion," a series of photographs taken by English photographer Eadweard Muybridge in 1878. Muybridge was hired by the industrialist Leland Stanford to settle a bet about whether a galloping horse ever had all four feet off the ground at once. To answer the question, Muybridge set up a series of cameras along a track and used tripwires to trigger the shutters as the horse ran past. He then used a device called a zoopraxiscope to project the images in sequence, creating the illusion of motion. While "Horse in Motion" was not a true movie in the sense that it was not projected onto a screen for an audience, it was a groundbreaking experiment in capturing and studying movement through photography.</p>
