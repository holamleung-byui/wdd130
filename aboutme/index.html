    <p>I'm from Hong Kong. This is my first semester after I graduated from the PathwayConnect courses. I'm working toward my Applied Technology BS degree. I hope to finish my degree by 2028.</p>
    <p>I feel very honoured to be an online student of BYU-Idaho. It is a blessing that I can earn a degree at an affordable cost. Also, I can study while I work full-time and take care of my family. It is a miracle to me.</p>
